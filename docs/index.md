Welcome to my portfolio site.  I am a recent Physics (M.Sc) grad with a background in Nanoscience (B.Sc). My experience includes work in both computational and hands-on lab environments involving materials science, and I have also studied irradiation damage in materials.  In my free time, I enjoy learning about advances in space science, metamaterials, and nuclear energy, engaging in insect conservation activities, and 3D printing my own digitally-sculpted models.

My thesis, *Characterizing Structure of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) Using Machine Learning*, is available through the following link to the [University of Ottawa Library](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/items/0f90b21a-f8d5-4479-9f08-d2b9463512c4).

**My contracting services include:**
* 3D model design and test printing
* Python and Bash programming
* Materials Simulation setup
* Nature stock photography
* AI image prompting
* Technical Writing
* Creative Writing

**Here are links to some of my recent projects with Python and Linux**
* [MatSimPy - A Python package for materials simulation](https://cleanit.github.io/MatSimPy/)
* [JobScraPy - A Python package to aid in parsing job opportunities](https://cjbr-97.github.io/JobScraPy/)
* [CleanupTools - Code for use with the SciNet Niagara supercomputer cleanup system](https://cjbr-97.github.io/CleanupTools/)

**Tutorials**

* [Copilot AI image prompt tutorial](prompting.md) --> If you have used an AI image generator before, you likely know the importance of precise word choices in your prompts.  This tutorial is meant as an informal guide to getting output that matches your vision.

* [Atomic figures in Blender tutorial](atomicblender.md) --> Struggling to draw perfect atoms in Word, Powerpoint, or Inkscape? Look no further than this tutorial on how to directly import your atomic files to Blender and take great rendered shots for journals and other publications.

**As well as some one-off examples of earlier work**
* [A simple 2D defect diffusion tutorial for NumPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CLEANit/tutorials/blob/master/2D_KMC_Example.ipynb)
* [A surface site representation tutorial for Pytorch & ASE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CLEANit/tutorials/blob/master/Pytorch_ASE_Surfaces.ipynb)
