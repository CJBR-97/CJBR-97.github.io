Welcome to my portfolio site.  I am a recent Physics (M.Sc) grad with a background in Nanoscience (B.Sc) enthused by space science, metamaterials, nuclear energy, and arthropods.

My Thesis is available through the following link to the [University of Ottawa Library](https://lnkd.in/g8mt7qPA).

**Here are links to some of my recent projects with Python and Linux**
* [MatSimPy - A Python package for materials simulation](https://cleanit.github.io/MatSimPy/)
* [JobScraPy - A Python package to aid in parsing job opportunities](https://cjbr-97.github.io/JobScraPy/)
* [CleanupTools - Code for use with the SciNet Niagara supercomputer cleanup system](https://cjbr-97.github.io/CleanupTools/)

**Tutorials**
* [Copilot AI image prompt tutorial](prompting.md)
* [Atomic figures in Blender tutorial](atomicblender.md)

**As well as some one-off examples of earlier work**
* [A simple 2D defect diffusion tutorial for NumPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CLEANit/tutorials/blob/master/2D_KMC_Example.ipynb)
* [A surface site representation tutorial for Pytorch & ASE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CLEANit/tutorials/blob/master/Pytorch_ASE_Surfaces.ipynb)
