# Prompt Guidelines for AI Tutorial (Copilot) [WIP]
**By C. Reimer**

After using Microsoft's Copilot AI for a little while, I was encouraged by colleagues to write up a summary of what I've observed so far and share my 'prompt engineering' toolkit.

## Styles
The flavour of a piece is an essential component that modifies almost every aspect of the result in some way. Try to keep in mind the essential lines, colours, shapes, and even subject matter of various artstyles, as Copilot seems to do better when working with familiar material, just as humans tend to.

For instance, something made in the style of "art deco" or "art nouveau" will be starkly different in tone than, say, "american gothic", with different (simulated) painting mediums, lighting, and levels of detail.

With that out of the way, let us highlight a few arbitrary art movement keywords and the traits that they can evoke from Copilot:  
1. **Art Deco** -->  A 1900s-1920s theme, tends towards lavish solid materials, well-defined edges and shadows, favours architecture
2. **Art Nouveau** --> A turn of the (20th) century style, favouring beautiful, organic, warm colourful scenes, card decorations
3. **Cyberpunk** --> Merging flesh and wires, circuit and sinew, this prompt often impacts backgrounds and characters severely, but can be well worth it
4. **Fantasy** --> Likely due to the influence of TTRPGs and comics, this prompt induces soft, 'modern' fantasy images with a pleasing (but not always memorable) look
5. **Hyborean** --> Old-fashioned, muscular barbarian style art

As well as some artstyle keywords:
1. **Sketch** / **Colour sketch** --> Great for Hyborean/gothic/lovecraftian horror B&W sketches, or older styles of comic and book illustration, concept art, etc.
2. **Illustration** --> More of a pencil/colour pencil look, lines/strokes may be visible
3. **Oil painting** --> More realistic painting feel, could be used for in-universe portraits and artwork
4. **Gritty comic** --> Fantastic semi-realistic look for characters and scenes, more well-defined edges and transitions than the 'Fantasy' prompt alone

Keep in mind that any of these can be combined in your prompts as well, though adding too many may make the resulting theme 'muddy' for lack of a better term.

Happy prompting!
