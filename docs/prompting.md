# Prompt Guidelines for AI Tutorial (Copilot) [WIP]
**By C. Reimer**

After using Microsoft's Copilot AI for a little while and sharing the results, I was encouraged by colleagues to write up a summary of what I've observed so far and share my 'prompt engineering' toolkit.

## Form & Expression
Form and expression are basic building blocks of character pieces such as portraits or cover art.  A good grab-bag of the many terms in English for expressions and states of being is very useful here:
1. **Lithe** --> Lean and muscular, might bias towards feminine outputs
2. **Withered** --> Shriveled, weak, bent over, useful for non-humanoids too
3. **Emaciated** --> Starved, ultra-lean creatures, ribs showing, patchy fur, etc.
4. **Husk** --> Like the withered output but on overdrive, bias towards much more corpse-like features
5. **Sunken eyes** --> Deep dark eyes, weary looking
7. **Ornate**, **embroidered**, **intricate**, **carved** --> Detail words with different meanings, I find they work best with metal, cloth, fine details, and stonework respectively
8. **Smirk**, **coy**, **sneer**, **cruel** --> Expression words that all involve subtleties of facial muscles without showing teeth
9. **Snarl**, **screech**, **bellow**  --> Expression words that show a sizeable amount of teeth

## Colour
Colours are one area of prompts that usually work fairly well without elaboration.  However, there is one particular tip that has served me well for avoiding the vaguaries of phrases such as "bright pink" or "deep blue"; classics often produce especially rich colours compared with generics.  The method is simply to use the traditional names for specific well-known colours derived from historic dyes and pigments.  

Here are a few examples that you can try:
1. **Indigo**, **cerulean** --> Deep famous blues
2. **Turquoise** --> A unique blue-green from copper ore
3. **Lavender** --> A delightful soft purple hue
4. **Ebon**, **sable**, **charcoal**, **jet** --> Dark colours from hardwoods, furs, fuel, and gems
5. **Vermilion** --> Bright, intense red from the mercury ore Cinnabar
6. **Scarlet** --> A deep and dark red
7. **Ochre** --> Deep earthy oranges, browns, yellows

## Styles
The flavour of a piece is an essential component that modifies almost every aspect of the result in some way.  Try to keep in mind the essential lines, colours, shapes, and even subject matter of various artstyles, as Copilot seems to do better when working with familiar material, just as humans tend to.

For instance, something made in the style of "art deco" or "art nouveau" will be starkly different in tone than, say, "american gothic", with different (simulated) painting mediums, lighting, and levels of detail.  Keep in mind that any of these can be combined in your prompts as well, though adding too many may make the resulting theme 'muddy' for lack of a better term.

With that out of the way, let us highlight a few arbitrary art movement keywords and the traits that they can evoke from Copilot:  
1. **Art Deco** -->  A 1900s-1920s theme, tends towards lavish solid materials, well-defined edges and shadows, favours architecture
2. **Art Nouveau** --> A turn of the (20th) century style, favouring beautiful, organic, warm colourful scenes, card decorations

As well as some artstyle keywords:
1. **Sketch** / **Colour sketch** --> Great for Hyborean/gothic/lovecraftian horror B&W sketches, or older styles of comic and book illustration, concept art, etc.
2. **Illustration** --> More of a pencil/colour pencil look, lines/strokes may be visible
3. **Oil painting** --> More realistic painting feel, could be used for in-universe portraits and artwork
4. **Gritty comic** --> Fantastic semi-realistic look for characters and scenes, more well-defined edges and transitions than the 'Fantasy' prompt alone
5. **Cyberpunk** --> Merging flesh and wires, circuit and sinew, this prompt often impacts backgrounds and characters severely, but can be well worth it
6. **Fantasy** --> Likely due to the influence of TTRPGs and comics, this prompt induces soft, 'modern' fantasy images with a pleasing (but not always memorable) look
7. **Hyborean** --> Old-fashioned, muscular barbarian style art
8. **Fey** --> Fey is a word with multiple meanings, but in the present it often refers to elvish themes and tends to yield magical flair and insect wings
9. **(Un)seelie** --> A good partner word to prompts for fey characters, seelie and unseelie refer to Scottish folklore surrounding good and bad fey respectively

Concerning AI art, my view is that the program makes art with the human as a director or patron commissioning the work.  Please use this remarkable tool responsibly and get some great images.

Happy prompting!
