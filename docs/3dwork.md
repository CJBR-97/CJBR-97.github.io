# 3D Modelling & Printing
**By C. Reimer**

For several years I have used Blender to make personal projects as well as some practical 3D models for printing. Here are some examples of my work.

## Example Projects

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: grey;">A personal 3D art project of a Pokemon fusion (Koffing x Magnemite).
